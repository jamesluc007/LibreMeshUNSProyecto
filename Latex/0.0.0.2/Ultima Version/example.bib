	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

	Abstract = {Low-cost wireless LAN equipment operating
in unlicensed spectrum has revolutionized local
area communications, introducing novel schemes
for open wireless connectivity and even new
business models. The ease of deployment of
Wi-Fi has made it ubiquitous in densely populated
urban areas, and it was just a matter of time
before wireless communities emerged. Using
inexpensive wireless technology to communicate,
autonomous wireless internetworks have been
built, offering a variety of broadband services.
Based on our own experience participating in
one of the largest wireless communities worldwide,
the Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network,
we attempt to explain their structure and
mechanisms, study the reasons for their emergence
and growth, and predict their future evolution.
We expect that future wireless
communities will be oriented toward providing
broadband access to nomadic users. To this end,
we have proposed that wireless network access
be shared in a peer-to-peer, reciprocal manner.
Thus, ubiquitous broadband Internet access can
be achieved at a low cost, at least in metropolitan
areas where there is abundant wireless coverage,
providing an inexpensive alternative to
broadband cellular services},
